    definition:
      acceptance_and_commitment_therapy: "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a mindfulness-based behavioral therapy that helps clients stop the futile struggle of trying to control or eliminate painful private experiences (thoughts, feelings, and sensations). Instead, clients learn **acceptance and diffusion** (seeing thoughts as just words). The goal is to move beyond emotional control and commit to taking **valued action**, living a rich, full life guided by what truly matters to them, even in the presence of discomfort."
      gestalt_therapy: "Gestalt Therapy is a humanistic, experiential approach that emphasizes **personal responsibility** and focuses intensely on the **'here and now'**. It encourages clients to increase their **awareness** of their sensations, emotions, and thoughts in the present moment. The therapist often uses creative techniques like the **Empty Chair** method or role-playing to help clients work through unfinished business from the past and integrate fragmented aspects of their personality into a cohesive whole."
      family_therapy: "Family Therapy, or systemic therapy, views emotional problems not as belonging to a single individual, but as arising within the **context of the entire family system and its patterns of interaction**. The therapist works with all family members together to identify unhelpful cycles, improve **communication skills**, establish healthier boundaries, and help the system function better as a unit. This often involves exploring the roles each member plays and how those roles maintain the problem."
      psychodynamic_therapy: "Psychodynamic Therapy is rooted in psychoanalytic theory, focusing on how **unconscious forces, internal conflicts, and early childhood experiences** (especially relationships with primary caregivers) shape an individual's current personality and behavior. The process involves frequent sessions where the therapist helps the client gain **insight** into their defensive patterns and explore how past dynamics are being replayed in current relationships, including the therapeutic relationship (**transference**)."
      emdr: "EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is an evidence-based, integrative psychotherapy developed specifically for **trauma and PTSD**. It works by using **bilateral stimulation** (typically side-to-side eye movements, auditory tones, or taps) while the client briefly focuses on a distressing memory. The purpose is to stimulate the brain’s natural processing system, allowing the traumatic memory to be fully processed, desensitized, and stored in a non-disturbing way."
      cbt: "CBT (Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy) is a structured, time-limited, and highly collaborative therapy that operates on the principle that **thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are all interconnected**. The client learns to identify and challenge **maladaptive or distorted thinking patterns** and replace them with more rational, balanced thoughts. Simultaneously, behavioral techniques are used to change unhelpful actions, allowing the client to achieve specific, measurable goals in their current life."
      dbt: "DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) is an intensive, skills-based therapy originally developed for Borderline Personality Disorder, but now used for various issues involving **severe emotion dysregulation**. It requires a strong commitment and teaches four core modules: **Mindfulness** (staying present), **Distress Tolerance** (getting through crises without making things worse), **Emotion Regulation** (understanding and managing intense feelings), and **Interpersonal Effectiveness** (getting needs met while maintaining self-respect)."
      relief_therapy: "Relief Therapy is not a formally defined or standardized school of therapy but is a generic term referring to any **short-term, rapid-response intervention** designed to provide **immediate symptomatic relief** from acute emotional distress, pain, or crisis. It prioritizes stabilization, safety planning, and finding the quickest path to reducing immediate suffering over deep, long-term psychological change."
      eft: "EFT (Emotionally Focused Therapy) is a humanistic and systemic therapy, most famous for its use in **couples counseling**, but also applied to families and individuals. It views relationship distress as a result of a threatened **attachment bond**. The therapist helps partners identify their cyclical, negative dance (e.g., 'pursuer/withdrawer'), understand the underlying soft emotions and attachment needs, and restructure their interactions to create a new, more secure and loving emotional bond."
      pct: "PCT (Person-Centered Therapy), also known as Client-Centered or Rogerian therapy, is built on the belief that every individual has an innate tendency toward growth and self-actualization. The therapist’s primary role is to create a safe, non-judgmental atmosphere through three core conditions: **Unconditional Positive Regard** (total acceptance), **Empathy** (deep understanding), and **Congruence** (genuineness). This environment empowers the client to discover their own solutions and move toward personal potential."
      art_therapy: "Art Therapy is an expressive therapy that uses **creative media** (painting, drawing, clay, collage, etc.) as the primary mode of communication and self-expression. It is particularly useful when feelings or experiences are too complex or painful to verbalize. The process of creating art, and then reflecting on the artwork with the therapist, helps the client gain insight, cope with stress, work through trauma, and reconcile emotional conflicts."
      rebt: "REBT (Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy), a precursor to modern CBT, is a highly directive and philosophical therapy that posits that people are largely disturbed by their **rigid, irrational, and demanding beliefs** about themselves, others, and the world ('musts' and 'shoulds'). The therapist actively teaches the client how to recognize, debate, and replace these dogmatic beliefs with flexible, rational alternatives, leading to healthier emotional responses."
      psychoanalysis: "Psychoanalysis is the original, intensive therapeutic method created by Sigmund Freud. It is typically long-term (years) and high-frequency (multiple times a week). The central aim is to bring the contents of the **unconscious mind** into conscious awareness. Techniques include **free association** (saying whatever comes to mind), dream analysis, and meticulous exploration of the relationship with the analyst (**transference**) to understand and resolve deep-seated conflicts."
      applied_behavior_analysis: "Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a scientific discipline concerned with applying empirical approaches based upon the principles of respondent and operant learning to change behaviors of social significance. It meticulously analyzes the **A-B-C relationship** (**A**ntecedent, **B**ehavior, **C**onsequence) to understand why a behavior occurs and systematically teaches new skills and reduces maladaptive behaviors, most commonly used in interventions for autism."
      exposure_therapy: "Exposure Therapy is a highly effective behavioral technique, primarily used for anxiety disorders, phobias, and PTSD. It works by systematically and repeatedly exposing the client, in a safe and controlled environment, to the **feared object, situation, or memory** without any real danger occurring. Over time, this process leads to **habituation**, breaking the conditioned fear response and teaching the brain that the fear is unwarranted."
      ifs: "IFS (Internal Family Systems) is a unique, integrative model that views the psyche as naturally composed of multiple **'parts'** (sub-personalities like the Inner Critic, the Manager, the Firefighter, etc.). The goal is to help the client access the **'Self'**—a core state of curiosity, compassion, and calm—to heal and harmonize these inner parts, allowing them to take on non-extreme, helpful roles."
      mindfulness_based_therapy: "Mindfulness-Based Therapy is an approach that integrates Eastern contemplative traditions with Western psychology. It teaches clients skills to cultivate **mindfulness**—the ability to pay purposeful attention to the present moment, without judgment, to thoughts, feelings, and body sensations. This practice fundamentally alters the relationship one has with distressing thoughts, reducing reactivity and preventing relapse into depression or anxiety."
      narrative_therapy: "Narrative Therapy is a respectful, non-pathologizing approach that posits that people experience problems when they adopt a **'problem-saturated story'** about their lives. The therapist works with the client to **externalize the problem** (separating the person from the issue) and co-create **'alternative stories'** that highlight the client's competence, strengths, and preferred identity, empowering them to live a life aligned with their values."
      solution_focused_brief_therapy: "Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) is an optimistic, short-term approach that stands out because it focuses almost exclusively on the client’s **desired future and existing strengths**, rather than analyzing the history of the problem. Key techniques include the **Miracle Question** (what life would look like if the problem disappeared overnight) and scaling questions, quickly mobilizing the client to notice and build upon successful actions."
      trauma_focused_therapy: "Trauma-Focused Therapy is a specialized umbrella approach that ensures treatment directly addresses the client's **trauma history and its residual effects**. Unlike non-trauma therapies, it involves specific, phase-based work: focusing first on **stabilization and safety** (emotion regulation), then on **processing the trauma memories** (e.g., via EMDR or CPT), and finally on **reintegration** and enhancing current functioning."
      play_therapy: "Play Therapy is a developmentally appropriate treatment used primarily for **children aged 3 to 12**. Since play is the child's natural language and work, the therapist provides a safe, limited space where the child can use toys, art, and sand to **express themselves, process emotional conflicts, and master anxieties** that they lack the verbal or cognitive ability to address through traditional talk therapy."
      group_therapy: "Group Therapy involves one or two therapists facilitating a session with a small number of clients (usually 6-12) who share a common issue (e.g., anxiety, grief, relationship issues). The format provides a powerful mechanism for change, offering clients **mutual support, immediate feedback** on their interpersonal style, and the realization that they are not alone (**universality**), allowing them to practice new behaviors in a safe, social microcosm."
      existential_therapy: "Existential Therapy is a philosophical approach that confronts clients with the four 'ultimate concerns' of human existence: **death, freedom (and responsibility), isolation, and meaninglessness**. The therapy aims to help clients acknowledge their anxiety about these realities, stop avoiding responsibility, and make conscious choices to live a life that is authentic, purposeful, and meaningful."
      integrative_therapy: "Integrative Therapy is not a single model but a flexible approach where the therapist **consciously and systematically combines theories, techniques, and concepts from various different therapeutic schools** (e.g., using a psychodynamic lens with CBT techniques). The approach is tailored to fit the unique needs, stage of development, and preferences of the individual client, rather than fitting the client to one single model."
      somatic_therapy: "Somatic Therapy is a body-oriented approach focused on the fundamental connection between the mind and the physical body. It operates on the idea that unresolved **trauma and emotional stress are held as physical tension or patterns** in the nervous system. The therapist guides the client to increase awareness of **physical sensations** (felt sense) to safely complete interrupted survival responses (e.g., fight/flight) and restore the body's natural regulatory capacity."
      interpersonal_therapy: "Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) is a highly structured, time-limited treatment, primarily evidence-based for **depression and eating disorders**. It focuses on improving the client's **current interpersonal functioning and social relationships** within one of four specific problem areas: grief, role disputes, role transitions, or interpersonal deficits. It addresses mood by improving the quality of the client's social environment."
      schema_therapy: "Schema Therapy, developed by Jeffrey Young, is an integrative approach that expands on CBT to address **deep, long-standing, pervasive emotional patterns** (Early Maladaptive Schemas) that began in childhood and adolescence (e.g., abandonment, subjugation, defectiveness). The therapy is long-term and uses a combination of cognitive restructuring, emotional techniques (imagery and chairwork), and behavioral pattern-breaking to heal the schemas."
      cognitive_processing_therapy: "Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is a specific, manualized form of CBT proven effective for **PTSD**. It focuses primarily on the **cognitive component** of trauma recovery, helping the client examine and challenge rigid or distorted thoughts about the trauma (called **'stuck points'**) related to five main themes: Safety, Trust, Power, Esteem, and Intimacy. This process leads to balanced beliefs and emotional accommodation of the event."
      exposure_and_response_prevention: "Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) is the specific, most effective behavioral treatment for **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**. The procedure involves two key steps: **Exposure** (the client deliberately confronts the objects, situations, or thoughts that trigger their obsession/anxiety) and **Response Prevention** (the client actively chooses to prevent themselves from performing the corresponding ritual or compulsion). This teaches the brain that the danger is false."
      motivational_interviewing: "Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a collaborative, person-centered style of communication designed to **strengthen a person's own intrinsic motivation and commitment to change**. It is highly effective for people who are **ambivalent** about changing a behavior (e.g., addiction, diet). The therapist uses empathy and carefully worded questions to **elicit change talk** from the client, resolving ambivalence and respecting autonomy."
      sensorimotor_psychotherapy: "Sensorimotor Psychotherapy is an advanced, body-oriented talk therapy that integrates cognitive and emotional processing with the body's movements and sensations. It specializes in treating **developmental and relational trauma** by tracking how the body reacts to memories. The therapist helps the client notice **implicit memory** (trauma stored in the body) and safely completes the biological actions (defenses) that were interrupted during the traumatic event."
      aedp: "AEDP (Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy) is a highly relational, emotion-focused model that capitalizes on **positive emotional experience** for deep, transformational healing. It focuses on facilitating **corrective emotional and relational experiences** in the present moment, helping clients 'undo aloneness' in the face of overwhelming emotions, thereby accelerating the client's natural self-righting and healing capacities."
      hakomi: "Hakomi is a mindfulness-centered somatic psychotherapy that is non-violent and highly respectful of the client's process. It uses a **state of mindfulness** within the therapeutic relationship to gently and efficiently access **core material**—deeply held memories and beliefs that organize the client's experience. Small physical and verbal experiments are used to gather information and facilitate rapid, deep change."
      pcit: "PCIT (Parent-Child Interaction Therapy) is an evidence-based treatment for young children (ages 2-7) with disruptive behavior problems. It involves two phases: relationship enhancement (DIR) and discipline skills (PDI). The therapist coaches the parent in real-time through an earpiece, guiding them to improve the **quality of the parent-child attachment bond** and teaching effective, consistent, and positive discipline techniques."
